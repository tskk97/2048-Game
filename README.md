# 2048 - Solving using Artificial Intelligence
# Objective:
In this project we aim to create an artificial intelligence to solve the 2048 game consistently i.e. trying to reach the score of 2048. We will be using the minimax algorithm for the main game play with alpha-beta pruning to reduce the redundant moves and use the combination of several heuristics to get the ideal heuristic to compare the validity of the different generated states in helping us reach the 2048 tile most consistently and efficiently.
